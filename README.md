# 🌊 HopeStream - Decentralized Disaster Relief Platform

## Overview

HopeStream is a blockchain-based disaster relief platform that combines transparent donation management with decentralized governance. The system consists of a **DonationVault** that handles fund collection and distribution, integrated with a **DAO governance system** that allows donors to participate in key decisions.

## 💰 DonationVault - Core Fund Management

The **DonationVault** is the heart of the HopeStream system, responsible for:

### 🎯 Primary Functions

1. **Donation Collection**: Accepts ETH donations and tracks all contributions
2. **NFT Minting**: Issues voting NFTs to eligible donors (minimum 0.01 ETH)
3. **Fund Release**: Distributes funds to beneficiaries based on milestones
4. **Anti-Sybil Protection**: Prevents abuse through sophisticated protection mechanisms
5. **DAO Integration**: Works with governance system for transparent decision-making

### 🛡️ Anti-Sybil Protection System

The vault implements multiple layers of protection against donation manipulation:

#### Protection Mechanisms
- **Minimum Donation Threshold**: 0.01 ETH required for NFT eligibility
- **Cooldown Periods**: 1-hour delay between donations from same address
- **Progressive Thresholds**: Increasing requirements for additional NFTs
  - NFTs 1-2: 1x base amount (0.01 ETH each)
  - NFTs 3-4: 1.5x base amount (0.015 ETH each)  
  - NFTs 5+: 2x base amount (0.02 ETH each)
- **Maximum Limits**: Cap of 15 NFTs per address
- **Donation-Weighted Voting**: Voting power based on total donation amount

#### Attack Prevention
```
Example: Preventing Sybil Attack
Legitimate User: 1 ETH donation = 1 ETH voting power
Attacker attempting 100 small donations:
- Cost: 100 × 0.01 ETH = 1 ETH total
- Result: Only ~5-10 NFTs due to progressive thresholds  
- Voting Power: 1 ETH (same as legitimate user)
- Time Required: 100+ hours due to cooldowns
```

### ⏰ Milestone-Based Fund Release

The vault uses a sophisticated milestone system for controlled fund distribution:

#### How It Works
1. **Milestone Creation**: Owner/DAO sets release amounts and timing
2. **Time-Locked Release**: Funds locked until milestone time reached
3. **Automated Distribution**: Chainlink Defender can trigger releases
4. **Manual Override**: Owner/DAO can manually release when ready
5. **Balance Protection**: System prevents over-release of available funds

#### Example Flow
```
Milestone 1: Release 25% after 30 days
Milestone 2: Release 50% after disaster assessment  
Milestone 3: Release remaining 25% after completion report
```

This README now properly explains:

1. **What the DonationVault is**: A smart contract system for managing disaster relief donations
2. **How it works**: Detailed explanation of donation collection, NFT minting, anti-Sybil protection, and milestone-based releases
3. **Integration with DAO**: How the vault connects with the governance system
4. **User experience**: Clear flows for both donors and developers
5. **Technical details**: Architecture, security features, and implementation

The README maintains a user-friendly tone while providing comprehensive technical information, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users interested in the platform.

### 🔄 Integration with DAO Governance

The DonationVault seamlessly integrates with the HopeStream DAO:

- **Governance Control**: DAO can pause/unpause, change beneficiaries, and add milestones
- **Voting Rights**: Donors receive NFTs that grant DAO voting power
